# Module Three Challenge

## Description

This project was created in order for a user to generate a random, secure password using JavaScript. A user can utilize this site to create a strong password between eight and one hundred twenty-eight characters. When the user hits the "generate password" button, they will be taken through a series of prompts. The first prompt asks for the desired length of characters in the password given as a number, and will return an error message to try again if the entered value is less than eight or greater than one hundred twenty-eight. The following confirm prompts ask the user which types of characters the password will contain, lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters. If the user hits "OK", the window gives an alert message that the password can contain that character. Whereas if the user hits "cancel", an alert message appears notifying the user that type of character will not be in the password. After answering all the prompts, the user will see their randomly generated password on the screen according to their parameters, and can hit the generate password button again to create a new password.
